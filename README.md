# Portfolio Website

A simple portfolio built from scratch with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Its purpose is to present my work as a software engineer with a focus on **freelance web development**.

## Features
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Navigation menu with mobile-friendly burger toggle
- Animated hero section
- Certifications and projects displayed (carousel + modal view)
- Contact section with phone, email, and social links
- Lightweight: no frameworks, only plain HTML/CSS/JS

## Development
Dependencies are optional. For consistent formatting and linting:
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code style
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript linting

Install and run:
```bash
npm install
npm run format
npm run lint
```

## Deployment
The site is hosted on AWS S3 (for static file storage) and distributed globally via Amazon CloudFront for fast, secure delivery.
